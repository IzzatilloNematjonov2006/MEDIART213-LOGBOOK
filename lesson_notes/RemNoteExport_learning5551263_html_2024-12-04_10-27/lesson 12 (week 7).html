        <li>Key Features: Dependency injection, two-way data binding, modular development.</li>
        <li>Use Case: Best for enterprise-level applications requiring complex logic and a strong structure.</li>
        <li>Vue.js</li>
        <li>Description: Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework that allows developers to incrementally integrate it into existing projects or use it as a full-featured framework for complex SPAs.</li>
        <li>Key Features: Lightweight, reactive data binding, single-file components.</li>
        <li>Use Case: Suitable for small to medium-sized projects and for developers looking for a balance between React’s flexibility and Angular’s structure.</li>

        <li>Properly describe images using the alt attribute to help search engines understand the content and context. This also improves accessibility for visually impaired users.</li>
        <li>Utilize Lazy Loading:</li>
        <li>Implement lazy loading to defer offscreen images. This means images below the fold won’t load until the user scrolls down, which can significantly speed up initial page load times.</li>
        <li>Use the HTML attribute: <q>&lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;</q> </li>
        <li>JavaScript libraries like Lozad.js or built-in browser support.</li>
        <li>Implement Responsive Images</li>
        <li>Use the &lt;picture&gt; element and the src set attribute to serve different image sizes based on the device’s resolution and viewport size:
            <ul>
