        <li>Reading notes:</li>
        <li>In this course, students will learn fundamental theories, design principles, and technical implementation of web media and applications. Specifically, students will design and create web-based media that specifically address communication, challenges, and<mark style="background-color: transparent; color: red;"> user experiences (UX) for diverse targeted groups</mark>. This course will cover various design methods and approaches, including technical aspects such as <mark style="background-color: transparent; color: red;">content management, responsive design</mark>, and <mark style="background-color: transparent; color: red;">server-side support</mark>. Moreover, students will learn essential programming skills, including <mark style="background-color: transparent; color: red;">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</mark>, and apply their knowledge through building a personal portfolio of web design and development work. By the end of the course, students will have the skills and confidence to create accessible, scalable, and visually appealing websites that meet industry standards which can effectively communicate to their target audience.</li>
        <li>Personal Logbook 
            <ul>
                <li>Throughout the class, we will become familiar with the fundamentals of web design and basic forms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This course emphasizes self-learning and finding your own path according to your unique needs. Each of you will need to acquire a specific set of skills. As a backbone of this class, each of you will develop a “Class Log”; a digital logbook where you will document everything you have learned in class or researched independently. The logbook will be submitted twice, first on week 4 as a midterm assignment for inspection of progress and second in addition to the final project.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>Lab Tutorials
            <ul>
                <li>Throughout the class, we will practice hands-on web design coding skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Lab tutorials will begin in the classroom and will continue as after-class assignments. Over time, these sessions will evolve into a group knowledge-sharing and support practice, which is essential for every coder. In total, we will have 10 lab sessions along with after-class assignments. The main objective is to develop personal problem-solving skills, practice troubleshooting and debugging, experience peer support, and learn web design infrastructure and tools.</li>

        <li>Web Media Critique Presentation and Report (groups)
            <ul>
                <li>A group assignment: Identify one website or web application and present a critique of the web media/applications in a class presentation for 10 mins + 3-5 mins questions. General Design and implementation framework/approaches. (The design aspect could be anything that is related to web design, e.g., atomic design, high contrast, readability, white space, less is more, etc.</li>

        <li>Individual Final Project Proposal
            <ul>
                <li>You will work on an individual project, which is to design and implement your own personal portfolio site OR a company&#39;s branding site (choose ONE). The final proposal will be a set of structural documents sharing the design and coding intentions for the final project (e.g. Research, intentions, Sitemap, Wireframe, Style Tile, etc)</li>
