        <li>Brad Frost reflects on a year spent integrating accessibility into web design, discussing the principles and practical methods that guided his work. His primary approach, progressive enhancement, emphasizes building web content in layers, starting with a robust HTML foundation and adding CSS and JavaScript for functionality. This approach ensures that content remains accessible, even if some layers fail. Through various examples, Frost explains how using semantic HTML improves screen reader compatibility and enhances the experience for users relying on assistive technologies. His journey highlights the need for empathy-driven, user-centered design and a commitment to inclusive practices.  </li>
        <li>Important Notes
            <ul>
                <li><b>Progressive Enhancement</b>: Build web interfaces by layering functionality, beginning with a basic HTML structure. CSS and JavaScript should be added on top, allowing the content to remain accessible even if JavaScript is disabled or fails​.</li>
                <li><b>Semantic HTML</b>: Meaningful use of HTML elements, such as headings and buttons, improves accessibility. Frost emphasizes structuring HTML based on content purpose rather than appearance, aiding screen readers and providing a logical navigation structure.</li>
                <li><b>User-Centered Accessibility</b>: Designing with empathy by considering a broad range of user needs fosters better accessibility. Involving users early in the design process and testing with diverse audiences ensures that interfaces are more inclusive and responsive to real needs​</li>

        <li>Notes by me:</li>
        <li>HTML is <mark style="background-color: transparent; color: red;">semantic</mark>, or in other words, it is descriptive and provides meaning — each HTML element describes the type of content it presents. </li>
        <li>By using correct elements, your document content will have conveyable <mark style="background-color: transparent; color: red;">structure </mark>and <mark style="background-color: transparent; color: red;">meaning</mark>.
            <ul>
                <li><img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/25nlkaQz1FlQeuYM3XePU6WvSAtfQTmQOWqhSjsa4Q7ZuwdQ3FC692gQuXyOsbIO_Z2rSclmCJsIjlmS_sZOW9PIgX6zyZuuvam1uQGL95wkAqmsQruBUQfd9KuhP0Ap.png" width="632" height="613.2959501557632"/></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>f you don’t use proper landmarks (exposed to screen readers via semantic HTML elements like &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;main&gt; and &lt;header&gt;), screen reader users may not be able to efficiently navigate the page and would have to search for their areas of interest more tediously.</li>
        <li>Headings also provide an outline or “skeleton” of the page that users can navigate using hot keys.</li>
        <li>But if you don’t use a &lt;button&gt; to create a button, and you choose to use a &lt;div&gt;, for example, instead, you lose all the built-in semantics and keyboard interactivity, making the button completely inaccessible to screen readers.</li>
        <li>ARIA attributes are possibly the most powerful tool in our accessibility arsenal.</li>
        <li><mark style="background-color: blue; color: inherit;">If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so.</mark> </li>
        <li>— semantic HTML! — and then layering styles (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript!)</li>
        <li>Use HTML. Enhance with CSS. Leverage the power of JavaScript. And include your users in your design process as early as possible. And always look at your work through the lens of inclusion. </li>
