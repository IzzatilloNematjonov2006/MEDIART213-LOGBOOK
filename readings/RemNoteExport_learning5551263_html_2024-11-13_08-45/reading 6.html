        <li>Reading (video in this case) summary by AI:</li>
        <li>David Dylan Thomas’s video <i>Design for Cognitive Bias</i> discusses how cognitive biases impact user decision-making and how designers can account for these biases. He emphasizes that understanding biases, such as confirmation bias or availability bias, allows designers to create fairer, more accessible products. Thomas suggests usingx inclusive design techniques, diversifying design teams, and creating systems that challenge assumptions, all to make products that respect diverse users&#39; needs and perspectives. </li>
        <li>Important notes from reading (video in this case):</li>
        <li>As humans, we have biases that affect our decision-making and behavior</li>
        <li>A cognitive bias is a series of shortcuts our minds take to help us get through the day but they can harm our decision-making</li>
        <li>Types of bias include: confirmation bias, notational bias, and self-serving bias</li>
        <li>We can use design fight bias – one way includes creating a Black Mirror episode to consider the ways a user might misinterpret or misuse technology</li>
