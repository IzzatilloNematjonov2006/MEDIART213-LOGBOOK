        <li>Reading summary  and important notes by AI:</li>
        <li>In <i>&quot;Toward a User-Centric Digital Ecosystem&quot;</i>, Mile K. Corrigan explores the concept of user-centric data management, where individuals control their personal data rather than organizations. The approach emphasizes the use of Personal Data Stores (PDS) to securely store and share user data, ensuring user consent and control over third-party access. This structure promotes data portability, privacy, and empowers users to manage and benefit from their &quot;digital footprint.&quot;</li>
        <li>Important Notes
            <ul>
                <li><b>Personal Data Stores (PDS):</b> Central repositories for individual data, under user control.</li>
                <li><b>Digital Footprint Management:</b> Individuals can track and manage data from multiple sources, enhancing privacy and ownership.</li>
                <li><b>Benefits of User-Centric Models:</b> Users gain transparency, personalized services, and economic value from sharing data.</li>
                <li><b>Privacy and Consent Focus:</b> Clear permissions regulate third-party access, aligning with user rights like data portability.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This model shifts away from organization-driven data systems, giving users control over how their data is used and shared.</li>

        <li>Collaborate. Developers and designers must collaborate to save time and reduce costs. </li>
        <li>• Take more upfront time. Spending more design time up front ensures frequent communication throughout all project phases. </li>
        <li>• Prototype before development. Prototypes enable course corrections before costly infrastructure is in place. </li>
        <li>• Align metrics to success factors. Develop metrics that align to critical success factors, such as saving customer’s time.   </li>
        <li>Elements of a responsive design:</li>
        <li>a fluid layout that uses a flexible grid, which in turn ensures that a website can scale to a browser’s full width; 
            <ul>
                <li>Fluid layout. To build a website with a fluid layout, the designer specifies content area width as browser window percentages.  </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>• images that work in a flexible context, whether fluid themselves or perhaps controlled through overflow mechanisms;
            <ul>
                <li>Layouts based on percentages resize gracefully according to the size of the browser window rendering them.   </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>media queries, which optimize the design for different viewing contexts and spot-fix bugs that occur at different resolution ranges.
            <ul>
                <li>CSS3’s media queries directly address these usability problems by allowing browsers to serve different styles for different viewing contexts. CSS2.1 introduced the ability to specify a stylesheet’s media type, including screen, print, and handheld. CSS3 greatly expands support for media queries, adding the ability to target media features such as screen and device width and orientation.  
                    <ul>
                        <li>@media only screen and (min-device-width:320px) and (maxdevice-width:569px) {  /*Styles for Smartphones (portrait and landscape)*/ } @media only screen and (min-width:321px) and (max-devicewidth:569px) { /*Styles for Smartphones (landscape only)*/}</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
