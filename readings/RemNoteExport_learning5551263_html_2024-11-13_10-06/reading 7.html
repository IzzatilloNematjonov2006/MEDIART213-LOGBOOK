        <li>Good portfolio shows you have necessary skills to work with.</li>
        <li>Time capsule, archive: collection of your past work</li>
        <li>Identify what job you&#39;re actually trying to get. Identify the specific job you want at that company. Create a message that addresses why you&#39;d be a great fit for that job</li>
        <li>If you’re applying for 4 jobs, you should have 4 different portfolios</li>
        <li>A great portfolio answers that question as clearly possible before any in-person interviews.</li>
        <li>&quot;go big or go home” approach: the site Francine Tamakloe put together to apply at Spotify. This site speaks directly to the role music has played in her life. She uses Spotify’s typographic style and gradient color palette. She frames her work style via song lyrics and embeds a Spotify player of each song nearby.</li>
        <li>A template for a great portfolio:</li>
        <li>Does the candidate have the skills to succeed at this job? 
            <ul>
                <li>For example, an they already write Rails code for apps that millions of people use simultaneously? Or, can they take a concept from a whiteboard sketch to a polished interface design without much help from others?</li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li>Can the candidate prove that they have the skills to succeed at this job?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Can the candidate prove that they have the skills to succeed at this job?  </li>
        <li>If they don’t already have the skills, how long would it take to learn them?
            <ul>
                <li>Each organization has its own tolerance for this. Organizations under stakeholder and/or shareholder pressure may want you to get up to speed in a few weeks, while others may be willing to give you up to a year to get your bearings. Beware: this tolerance is rarely discussed internally or even acknowledged. It’s often “just a feeling” that the hiring manager may have.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How well would the candidate fit in here?  </li>
