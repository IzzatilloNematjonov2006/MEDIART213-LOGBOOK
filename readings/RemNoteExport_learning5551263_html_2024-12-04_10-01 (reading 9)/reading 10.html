        <li>Reading notes:</li>
        <li>A designer is a human being. A designer impacts the people who come in contact with your work. The effect of what you put into the fabric of society should always be a key consideration in your work.</li>
        <li>A designer is responsible for the work they put into the world. Therefore, you should not be surprised when a gun you designed kills someone, or a database that groups immigrants causes a deportation of those immigrants.</li>
        <li>A designer should fear the consequences of their work more than the cleverness of their ideas.They should judge the value of their work based on its impact on society rather than aesthetic considerations. (i.e. an object that is designed to harm people cannot be said to be well-designed, no matter how aesthetically pleasing it might be)</li>
        <li>A designer owes the people who hire them not just their labor, but their counsel. Designer’s responsibilities are to design smth. And to evaluate its impact and effectively communicate the impact of that work to a client or an employer.</li>
        <li>A designer welcomes criticism. The role of criticism is to evaluate and improve work- it makes good better and keeps bad from seeing the light of day.</li>
        <li>A designer tries to learn more about their audience. Design is a solution to a problem within a set of constraints. Therefore a designer needs to meet people who are having those problems. (i.e. If you want to know how women would use something you’re designing, get a woman on the team that’s designing it.)</li>
        <li>A designer does not believe in edge cases. A designer who ignores &quot;edge cases&quot; isn&#39;t truly designing for everyone. When we decide who our work is meant for, we’re also deciding who it is not for. This mindset excluded people, sending the message that some problems aren’t worth solving. (i.e.single moms struggling with rules requiring &quot;both parents&quot; to sign forms.)</li>
        <li>A designer is a part of a professional community. They should not earn a living at the expense of others (i.e. if you do not hold your ground on doing bad work, the designer behind you will have to work twice as hard to make up for it.)</li>
        <li>A designer welcomes diversity and a competitive field. A designer seeks to learn, listens to other people’s experiences, encourages people from diverse cultures and backgrounds and those who society has kept down.</li>
        <li>A designer takes time for self-reflection. Take time to think about your decisions and their impact on people. If you made a mistake, correct it.</li>
