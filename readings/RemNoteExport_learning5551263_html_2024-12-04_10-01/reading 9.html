        <li>Reading notes:</li>
        <li>When starting a new website project, designers often focus on aesthetics and functionality of their work. Therefore, content creation belongs to the client, who does not have much to say and what they say is often said badly. Clients fail to write persuasive and informative content, and the content usually comes in the wrong format and of poor quality.
            <ul>
                <li>The difference between design &amp; content
                    <ul>
                        <li>Content is the tangible material that people cognitively consume (i.e. words, picture, video, audio, etc…)</li>
                        <li>Design is the presentation of that content (influences how people feel)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Why we should start with the content:
            <ul>
                <li>Architect Louis Sullivan’s quote:
                    <ul>
                        <li><img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/1AlXWk5aN7rQyhWT-ZwHvGkbO6oQiG594SwwmLLksjKGEgg2WW1kzrYGZM0QUoqcKcyAgdEdwHYcB6eG_FZkry0HCb9xx-GX-QfXdvS6IQMHCGBtqfMGJl0g6rIG9iro.png" width="718" height="228.81318681318683"/></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Websites that do not meet real world needs, would be impractical, regardless of how nice it appears. UX designers are intended to be a bridge between form and function- web design &amp; communication of the content. However, due to limited budget, this responsibility often falls on a web designer who focuses on aesthetics.</li>
        <li>➔Emergence of the vacuum- content production</li>
        <li>A web designer focuses on aesthetics.</li>
        <li>The client is more interested in what the website can do for them. Thus, their role is to bring their business objectives.</li>
        <li><b>There is a need for professional content production.</b> </li>
        <li>What to if your client cannot afford copyrighting</li>
        <li>➔Advantages of a professional website copy:</li>
        <li>Communicate the brand message clearly</li>
        <li>Save a lot of time for the web designer and client</li>
        <li>Make the design more effective</li>
        <li>Result in a better end user experience</li>
        <li>➔Why clients claim they “cannot afford” copyrighting:</li>
        <li>They do not understand the amount of return on investment</li>
        <li>Strategies for the fusion of design and content</li>
        <li>1. <b>Organize a content workshop with your client</b> in which the web designer should discuss general objectives (i.e. expectations of a visitor from the page, the specific group of people the content is created for) and try to explain the meaning of content, showing some good/bad examples of it. Explain the difference between design and content.</li>
        <li>2. <b>Integrate content writing into the delivery process.</b> Partner with a copywriter ahead of time (i.e. the web designer wants to prepare a quote).</li>
        <li>To prevent the client from dropping the content writing due to its price, include the following statement into your proposal:</li>
        <li><img src="https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/dhYjyQvsjVJFLPSGKDXUCpxm3yA60J1pyVgYw0y17gjLUDtRSW8KoFW_R1yVwHsGjRZIATFX59_ENFlw5LTY-Ayf7zxt-wbx7lF72S_VetaoyA27X3rsE8lU0IiHC0EA.png" width="766" height="192.48711340206185"/></li>
        <li></li>
        <li>3. <b>Use real content as early on in the project as you can</b> because the content writing tends to get subsumed by the design process.</li>
        <li>4. <b>Understand your clients’ mission and values</b>, ask for their differences from their competitors, their objectives. If possible, contact their customers to ask for their feedback on your client and experience with them. The web designer’s responsibility is to translate these responses into useful content and right design decisions.</li>
        <li>5.    
 <b>If the client is to write their own content, make it easy for them</b> by delaying focusing on visual design until you get a real content,
 giving the client a content-delivery deadline, providing them with templates
 and constraints to produce content that will work well, and making the content
 production only one individual’s responsibilty.</li>
        <li>Conclusion:</li>
        <li>It is important to take content seriously as
 it contributes to a better end user experience and focus on composition and
 user experience. Getting the message across in the clearest way possible is
 crucial as well.</li>
