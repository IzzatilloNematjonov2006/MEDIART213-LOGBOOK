        </li>
        <li>There are a subset of users for whom high contrast is a barrier.  </li>
        <li>Increasing font size doesn&#39;t help for Dyslexia people as dyslexics read words and can struggle with forming the right sound, and then add meaning to the sound. For them, it&#39;s audio condition, not visual condition.</li>
        <li>Extra white spaceâ€¦ again there is no evidence presented for this and again this is an Irlens issue.  </li>
        <li>Summary:</li>
        <li>In this LinkedIn article, the writer points out that not everyone using website/web browser/web service is not fully physically capable. In this specific case, he writes about people with Dyslexia, which makes them struggle with understanding words they read and forces them to use sounds to get the meaning. He goes over some misconceptions design methods that people think help with accessibility, but in reality, that do not.</li>
